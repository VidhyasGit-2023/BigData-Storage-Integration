       -l when it is displaying without any color and is there is a hypen then it is a file otherwise it is a file
	                - vi filename
to exit the file content - :q or ctrlC
To create a new file - vi filename and then press i for insert mode and then type in the text
save and exit - press escape to come out of insert mode and then type ':wq' - to write and quit the file
To search for the text - /text to search (forward slash)
quit the file without saving - :q!
instead of vi to open the file we can use - nano filename (more helpful with the list of commands showing at the end)
view the content without opening the file - cat filename
view the content without opening the file just only few lines (new screen) - less filename
view the content without opening the file just only few lines (in the same editor terminal)- more filename

relative path (Starts from current directory- ls new/ - cp test.txt newdirectory/test1.txt
Full qualified path (Starts from root directory) -  cp /home/username/test.txt /home/newdirectory/. (Same file name then use only dot)
