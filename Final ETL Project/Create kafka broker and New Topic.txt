## Create & Describe Topic ##

-- following command should be executed under the Confluent directory
-- Creating a topic first
-- run this command from one of the servers
-- inside the Confluent directory type:

bin/kafka-topics --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --topic vidhya-my-news

-- To delete the topic

bin/kafka-topics --delete --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic vidhya-my-news


-- Need to specify where zookeper is running
-- partitions is the number of partitions you want to create (you can have more than one partition per nod)
-- replication factor is set to 1 since we have one node (but usually 3 for replication factor)


-- Now run a describe command to get more details about the topic

bin/kafka-topics --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic vidhya-my-news

-- Should see # of partitions, leader, Isr's --> not very exciting when you have one node
